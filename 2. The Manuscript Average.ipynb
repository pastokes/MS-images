They are intended as teaching aids for the course on 'Image Processing with Python' which is part of the École d'été d'éditions numériques / humanités numériques (EDEEN). For more details see https://edeen.sciencesconf.org.

Doing this shows very vividly the consistency (or lack thereof) in layout, and also highlights any specific pages which vary significantly from the norm. You can see the original blog post at http://jessehurlbut.net/wp/mssart/?page_id=2097\n",

There's a small problem here in that if the transparency is too small then the images seem to come out as black, so we have to set a minimum transparencey as well.
