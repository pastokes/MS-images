    "In a very interesting blog post, Jesse Hurlbut proposed different ways of calculating a 'manuscript average', by taking all the images of a complete manuscript and overlaying them on top of each other in different ways. Doing this shows very vividly the consistency (or lack thereof) in layout, and also highlights any specific pages which vary significantly from the norm. You can see the original blog post at http://jessehurlbut.net/wp/mssart/?page_id=2097\n",

We have already learned everything we need to do this in the first exercise; we just need to put it all together. This can also be done with the Python Image Library (PIL), and in some ways PIL is easier to use, but we are already familiar with skimage, and using it gives us a clearer idea of what's going on and allows us to go a bit further in our understanding of Python."

There's a small problem here in that if the transparency is too small then the images seem to come out as black, so we have to set a minimum transparencey as well.
