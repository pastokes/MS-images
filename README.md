# MS-images

This is a colletion of materials for processing images of manuscripts using Python. It is intended primarily for teaching purposes, aimed at students in the Humanities who have little or no specialist expertise in programming or image processing. As such, it is not intended to represent the latest in the field but is rather to show relatively simple techniques that are likely to be useful for the Humanities.
