This means that we turn the image into a simple black and white, where dark sections (i.e. ink) are white, and light sections (i.e. background) are black. The method we use here is reproduced from 'Simple Image Segmentation with Scikit-Image': http://douglasduhaime.com/posts/simple-image-segmentation-with-scikit-image.html It works using the same approach that we saw in the previous worksheet on 'Finding Rubrics in a Manuscript Page', the details of how it works are a bit complicated, so don't worry if you don't understand it fully. In summary, though, it does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the image from colour to gray (since we don't need colour anymore).\n",
    "1. Calculate the threshold level of how dark something needs to be to colour it white, and vice versa. To do this we use a built-in function.\n",
    "1. Create a 'mask', that is, a map of all the pixels with value `True` if the pixel value is below the threshold, and `False` if it is above the threshold.\n",
    "1. Use the built-in `segmentation.clear_border` function to remove any `True` pixels at the border of the image, as these are almost certainly just rubbish.\n",
